# Library Management System

## Problem Statement

In a library, it can be hard to manage many books and members manually. It also takes time to keep record of which book is issued and which book is returned. So, we made this simple Library Management System to make these works more easy.

In this project, librarian can add or remove books and members. Members can see books, issue books, return them and pay fine if they have any.

## Scope of the Project

This project is mainly made for basic library work. It includes:

- Register and remove library members
- Add and remove books
- See all books and members
- See which books are available
- Issue a book to a member
- Return borrowed books
- Calculate and pay fine
- Check some wrong inputs like name, phone number and numbers
- Reuse old member and book IDs
